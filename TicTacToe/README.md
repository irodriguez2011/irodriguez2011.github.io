I created a local TicTacToe game. One player starts with "X" and then player "O" is next. The winner is determined when whichever player matches their "X" or "O" horizontally, diagonally or vertically. The game goes through three rounds and after the final round is determined.

Technlogies used: HTML,CSS, and Vanilla Javascript

Technical challenges/errors: If players have a draw for each round, there is no indication that both lost.
